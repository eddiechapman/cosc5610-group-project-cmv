I happen to hate that about Chinese culture.  But I don&amp;#39;t hate every Chinese person I see, because (a) I don&amp;#39;t actually know if they subscribe to that element of their national culture or not and (b) even if they do, I might have empathy for their situation, being raised to have such a toxic belief, rather than hatred towards them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about this: can you hate murder but not hate a murderer?

You might say that the religion as a whole should not be disliked, but if you have a problem with someone who acts a certain way you should direct your dislike towards that individual. I would say that the religion as a whole deserves to be hated if you disagree with it, and anyone who interprets it in a positive way deserves to be praised. I have ethical problems with a lot of religions, if you chose to interpret one of those religions in a way that I like, good for you, but I am basing my hate or praise of that religion based on how I interpret it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cni4pet", "created": 1420724954.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1420696154.0, "ups": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "link_id": "t3_2rpcgr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": ["cnibc7m"], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cni95lr", "gilded": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WHErwin", "parent_id": "t3_2rpcgr", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"HATE THE SIN, NOT THE SINNER\" is the same thing as \"Hate the religion, not the religious.\" Unless you're ok with the religious hating on homosexuality you are not justified to hate on religion.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;HATE THE SIN, NOT THE SINNER&amp;quot; is the same thing as &amp;quot;Hate the religion, not the religious.&amp;quot; Unless you&amp;#39;re ok with the religious hating on homosexuality you are not justified to hate on religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cni95lr", "created": 1420740618.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1420711818.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "link_id": "t3_2rpcgr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": ["cnijsow"], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cnibc7m", "gilded": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Aaberg123", "parent_id": "t1_cni95lr", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's not really the same.
