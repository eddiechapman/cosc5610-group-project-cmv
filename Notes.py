#At point of "freezing" (i.e. a reputable poster has entered the scence), measure:
    #1) Rate of co-commenting: When a 200 delta power user has entered, do we see a higher

    #2) Rate of delta awarding: Aggregated, what is the rate at which deltas are awarded in the thread

    #3) Topic modeling: How similar are reputable users in shared interests to OP/co-commentators. What about the users that followed
        #I.e. do reputable users attract similarly minded users?
